      <h4>1. OverWorld</h4>
      
      <img src="world.jpeg">
      
      <p>In the most recent builds, the Minecraft overworld is able to generate nearly indefinitely. However, the player isn't able to make use of the infinite map under normal circumstances; the world generates an invisible barrier that’s 30 (though some sources state 32) million blocks in each direction from the centre of the map .</p>

<p>Using modifications or other dubious means, one can see that the world generation beyond the normal 'edge' becomes simplified and sometimes distorted. According to some sources, if a Minecraft block was recreated in real life, it would be 1 metre cubed in size. Assuming this is correct, the explorable Minecraft overworld is bigger than some planets!</p>
      
      <h4>2. Creepy Stuff</h4>
      
      <img src="creepy.jpeg">
      
      <p>The iconic Creeper monster was actually created from a coding error. In a Twitter conversation in February of this year, Minecraft developer Nathan ‘Dinnerbone’ Adams responded to a fan enquiring about the Creeper's origins, stating how they were born from Notch accidentally swapping the height and length values when generating a pig.</p>
     
      <h4>3. Herobrine</h4>
      
      <img src="hero.jpeg">
      
      <p>Early in Minecraft's life, many users began reporting strange happenings and sightings of a mysterious figure in the distance that was apparently following them. This entity - which looked like the default player character, only with ghostly white eyes - was known as Herobrine. Herobrine has been the subject of many a horror story, being able to possess a will of its own that far exceeds that of other AI characters.</p>

<p>Despite appearing in the background of some official promotional material and being the subject of a cheeky reference now and again, Herobrine actually isn't present in the normal Minecraft game at all. Or so we think...</p>
      
      <h4>4. Splashing Out</h4> 
      <img src="text.png">
      
      <p>On the Minecraft title screen, there's a small yellow piece of text known as a 'splash'. They're randomly generated and contain a whole host of cool references. Some examples include: "Gargamel plays it!" "Cooler than Spock!" and "Does barrel rolls!" These are nods to The Smurfs, Star Trek and Star Fox respectively but there are over 200 of these amusing messages, with some only appearing during special circumstances. For example, deleting a file that contributes to generating the splashes will result in the word "missingno" appearing, a reference to the infamous glitch Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Red and Blue. "Toilet friendly!" exclusively appears on the Pocket Edition of the game.</p>
